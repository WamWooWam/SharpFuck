# SharpFuck
SharpFuck is a compiler that takes (pretty much) any BrainFuck program and compiles it into to a .NET executable or class library.

# Usage
```
--help
    Show this help text.

--run=<filename>
    Runs a brainfuck file by compiling then executing it.

    --bench
        Measures the amount of time required to run the specified file.

--compile=<filename>
    Compiles a brainfuck file.

    --out=<filename>
        Specifies the output of the compiler. Defaults to <in_filename> + ".exe".
        If you wish to output a class library, make sure the file name ends in ".dll".
    --assembly=<name>
        Specifies the resulting assembly name. Defaults to "BF2IL".
    --type=<name>
        Specifies the resulting type name. Can contain namespaces. Defaults to "BF2IL".

# Getting Started
To compile SharpFuck, you can use any C# compiler that supports the new `.csproj` format and outputting .NET Framework assemblies, including the .NET Core SDK on Windows, and Visual Studio >= 2017. 

Unfortunately the compiler requires APIs that are currently unavailable in .NET Core itself, and as such depends on the .NET Framework. However, the executables and libraries generated by the compiler will work on any .NET runtime.

# Why?
Because I could, and in doing so I learnt a fair bit about how MSIL works, about how BrainFuck works and about writing not-wank command line interfaces.
